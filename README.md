# Extra Assignment: Console Golf Game.
## The Golf Game - the comand line version.

This is an older assignment that I got as "extra" in the
C# .Net education.<br>Took me two workdays time to make this.
Made a simple UML Class diagram and a flow chart to have
a clue of what I was going to do. And that took me like
1/3 of the total time - but absolutely worth it!
<br>The charts are still crude and I think I leave it to that,
I will have other more important things to do, and this will
also show that the prestudy and the final solution is not
spot on, but well done prestudy is not so far away and
mostly half of the work done. You can take a look att the
combined charts in thee repo. I made it in free version of
Lucid and I got limited in size just by combining the charts.
<br>The xUnit-tests is not that extensive. I just used 10.

One of the exercise tasks was skipped: throw an exception
if out of bound.<br>

Made it solo, with not any claims for best solution or best practice.
<br>
Please take a look, and I hope you can enjoy it!

P.S. At first I had an idea of winning the game. But from my rememberence of golfing with my young boys, we just strolled along the golf course and enjoyed ourself. So I removed the "You won" and I cheer everyone that have made the course within the Par+5 or something.
